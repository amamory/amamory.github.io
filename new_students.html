        		<h1> Research Topics for Students</h1>
                
		<p> Since July 2020, <b>I am not working at PUCRS anymore</b>. If you are looking for a research position in <b>Robotics</b>, please contact Prof. Rafael Garibotti. If you are looking for a research position in <b>Computer Architecture</b>, please talk to the profs of the GAPH group. </p>
			
		<p>  I am looking for ambitious and motivated people (undergrad, master, PhD, and PosDoc students) to work in my research subjects.  I work on two main research areas (<a href="./research/robotics/index.html">Robotics</a> and <a href="./research/vlsi/index.html">VLSI Design</a>). Please read these websites carefully and try to find some project that you are most interested. Feel free to send me a brief email, summarizing your research interests, your course, and current semester. Despite of the research in robotics or VLSI you will get to read many papers, opportunities to review and publish papers, and travel to conferences. Beyond the technical aspects listed below, you will also develop writing and communication skills and to use cutting edge resources of the labs.</p>

				<p> My research in <b>Robotics</b> involves the following subjects/resources:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Hardcore Linux programming/usage with experience in Makefile, CMake, scripts;</li>
                        <li> Programming with robotic Middleware such as <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> or <a href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/index.php?src=player">Player</a>, distributed programing;</li>
                        <li> Programing for machines, not humans :). No GUIs or auto-complete programming environment. Just a text editor and a compiler;</li>
                        <li> Programming for embedded computers such are Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, Odroid, NVIDIA Tegra, PLC;</li>
                        <li> Use protocols (SPI, I2C, PWM, serial, modbus, etc) to interface the robot`s computer with robot`s sensors and actuators;</li>
                        <li> Some basic image processing; </li>
                        <li> Some basic mechanical design with Solidworks and similar and 3D printing; </li>
                        <li> Building some cool robots ... See my Robotic research page and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFeY7d8mYvbmkpbebp1LCZw">Youtube Channel</a> !</li>
                        <li> Be the interface with Engineers Roboticists and the Computer Science Roboticists;</li>
                    </ul>
                <p> If you are great at or more of those skills, feel free to email me: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Linux programming with C/C++/Python;</li>
                        <li> Strong C/C++ coding and debugging skills;</li>
                        <li> If you don`t expect to learn robot programming in two months. Be aware the some projects might get years of hard work ... bringing a robot to life is not an easy thing. Robotics is not for the impatients !; </li>
                        <li> Strong passion to understand how robots work and build smart and collaborative robots; </li>
                        <li> Great writing skills for technical documents (papers, manual, technical reports); </li>
                    </ul>

            <p> My research in <b>VLSI</b> involves the following subjects/resources:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Design and programming MultiProcessor SoCs;</li>
                        <li> Propose testable and fault tolerant circuits and systems;</li>
                    </ul>
                <p> If you are great at or more of those skills, feel free to email me: </p>

                        <li> Experience with VHDL/Verilog/SystemC/Testbenchs;</li>
                        <li> Experience with VLSI CAD tool vendors such as Mentor, Cadence, Synopsys;</li>
                        <li> Experience with VLSI CAD tool for simulation, logical synthesis, physical synthesis, Design for Testability, BIST, ATPG, fault simulation; </li>
                        <li> Computer architecture and Operating System for multiprocessor systems; </li>
                        <li> Low-level programming for embedded systems in C/C++ and Linux; </li>
                    </ul>
