ABSTRACT = {The use of robotics in disaster scenarios has become a reality. However, an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) needs a robust navigation strategy to face unpredictable environmental forces such as waves, wind, and water current. A starting step toward this goal is to have a programming environment with realistic USV models where designers can assess their control strategies under different degrees of environmental disturbances. This paper presents a simulation environment integrated with robotic middleware which models the forces that act on a USV in a disaster scenario. Results show that these environmental forces affect the USV&rsquo;s trajectories negatively, indicating the need for more research on USV control strategies considering harsh environmental conditions. Evaluation scenarios were presented to highlight specific features of the simulator, including a bridge inspection scenario with fast water current and winds.},

ABSTRACT = {Disaster robotics has become a research area in its own right, with several reported cases of successful robot deployment in actual disaster scenarios. Most of these disaster deployments use aerial, ground, or underwater robotic platforms. However, the research involving autonomous boats or Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) for Disaster Management (DM) is currently spread across several publications, with varying degrees of depth, and focusing on more than one unmanned vehicle&mdash;usually under the umbrella of Unmanned Marine Vessels (UMV). Therefore, the current importance of USVs for the DM process in its different phases is not clear. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey about the applications and roles of USVs for DM, as far as we know. This work demonstrates that there are few current deployments in disaster scenarios, with most of the research in the area focusing on the technological aspects of USV hardware and software, such as Guidance Navigation and Control, and not focusing on their actual importance for DM. Finally, to guide future research, this paper also summarizes our own contributions, the lessons learned, guidelines, and research gaps.},

Although there are many serialization libraries out there, only some of them focus on resource usage, which is of most importance for the embedded domain. Thus, a comparison of serialization libraries considering resource usage is of high relevance for the embedded systems domain. This paper presents an experiment-based comparison of serialization libraries while concentrating on resource usage for a multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) platform. Results show that MsgPuck library surpasses other libraries for both serialization speed and memory consumption criteria.},

abstract={Resilient circuits are becoming a popular alternative to cope with process, voltage, and temperature variability under ultra-deep-submicron technology. Timing resilient architectures rely on error detection logic (EDL) to detect and recover from timing violations. Different EDLs have been proposed to either reduce the area overheads associated with the additional circuitry or to reduce recovery time, but most of them do not account for testability. This paper proposes a testable EDL (TEDL) architecture for manufacturing and field testing. Fault coverage and area overhead are illustrated on a resilient implementation of Plasma, a 3-stage OpenCore MIPS CPU, which contains the proposed testable EDL circuitry. The results show that 100\% of the stuck-at faults of the TEDL are detectable with 4.61\% area overhead when compared to the Plasma with the original EDL design.},

abstract={Current multiprocessor systems might comprise dozens of processors, requiring a runtime management to provide performance while complying with system's constraints such as energy consumption, thermal balance, and fault tolerance. Self-adaptive multiprocessor systems have been proposed to cover some key aspects such as hardware abstraction, programming models and modular software architecture. This paper provides a modular middleware to assist the development of self-adaptive services and applications on MPSoC environments. Based on key design patterns, the proposed middleware uses highly efficient features of object-oriented programming for embedded systems and specific compiler optimization options. The results show a case study of a self-adaptive application on top of the proposed middleware. Additional experiments demonstrate a reduction in the execution time from 3\% up to 19\%, presenting a memory footprint overhead of 8.7\% when compared to previous middleware without the features to ease modular software design.},

abstract={Shared memory and message passing are traditional parallel programming models used on multiprocessor system-on-chip environments. Underlying models are traditionally meant for static scenarios where all communicating entities and their intercommunication patterns are known a priori by the software engineer. The systems design following such programming models became complex due to dynamic behavior of applications at runtime. The goal of this work is to incorporate a publish-subscribe programming model to an MPSoC framework to decouple, in the time and space, the application development. The modified MPSoC framework is composed of a FreeRTOS kernel running on homogeneous processing elements distributed into a network-on-chip. The results present reduction around of 2\% to 30\% in DTW application execution time, and low overhead in memory footprint when comparing the original MPI primitives with the publish-subscribe programming model.},

abstract={Type D flip-flop cell and its scannable version called Muxed-D are the most used sequential components in cell-based synchronous designs because it simplifies timing analysis and it is less susceptible to race problems. However, as technology nodes shrink, it becomes more difficult, especially for high-performance designs, to cope with a hard global timing boundary. The use of latches emerges as a possible solution to the contemporary design challenges such as clock skew/jitter, PVT variation, and low-power and high-performance designs. Moreover, latches are also gaining popularity among asynchronous and timing resilient circuits. One of the available scannable cells for latches is called level sensitivity scan-based design (LSSD). The goal of this brief is to present an open design of an optimized single-latch LSSD cell, which has better tradeoffs between propagation delay, power, energy, and silicon area than the original LSSD design, thus reducing the cost for testing latch-based designs.},

pages={524-537}, 
abstract={Aggressive scaling of CMOS process technology allows the fabrication of highly integrated chips such as NoC-based MPSoCs. However, fault probability increases when devices’ size reduces. Hence, fault tolerant design has an important role in current nanometric technologies, leading to research on fault mitigation techniques for NoC-based MPSoCs. Most of the state-of-the-art papers present partial solutions to design a fault tolerant MPSoC, i.e., they present fault tolerant mechanisms for either NoCs or processing elements (PEs). Thegoalof this paper is to propose a comprehensive integration of previously defined recovery mechanisms. The mainnoveltyis the system-level integration itself, which is organized in a hierarchical and distributed manner, ensuring the correct execution of applications in the presence of multiple transient or permanent faults in both the NoC and/or the PEs. The combination of both NoC and PE recovery methods enable the proposed system to tolerate a very severe number of faults. Depending on the severity of the fault in the NoC, it may operate in degraded mode or require the search of fault-free paths. In both cases, the communication is reestablished in less than 50 microseconds. Faults detected into the PEs fire a lightweight and fast task relocation protocol, which executes in less than one millisecond.},

abstract="The innovations on integrated circuit fabrics are continuously reducing components size, which increases the logic density of systems-on-chip (SoC), but also affect the reliability of these components. Chip-level global buses are especially subject to crosstalk faults, which can lead to increased delay and glitches. This paper evaluates different crosstalk fault tolerant approaches for Networks-on-chip (NoCs) links such that the network can maintain the original network performance even in the presence of errors. Three different approaches are presented and evaluated in terms of area overhead, packet latency, power consumption, and residual fault coverage. Results demonstrate that the use of CRC coding at each link is preferred when minimal area and power overhead are the main goals. However, each one of the methods presented here has its own advantages and can be applied depending on the application.",
